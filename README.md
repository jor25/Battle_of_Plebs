# Battle_of_Plebs
Attempting to make a small multiplayer game with custom artwork.
Later will develop AI for this project.

# Set Up:
* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install pygame`
* `pip install pillow`

# Note:
* When making sprites:
    - Png Dimensions: Height = 315, Width = 280
    - Characters - Must be facing the left - or looking to the left initially.
    - Create a basic template first before applying colors or styling.
    - Make sure the background is transparent.
